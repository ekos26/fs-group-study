### Install Dependencies

Run `npm install`. This should install the dependency `jest`, a npm package used for testing.

### Example Usage

If you want to work on `check-palindrome`, run the command `jest check-palindrome/test.js --watch` from the root folder.

This will watch for any changes in the `index.js` file in the folder `check-palindromes`.

As you work on a solution and save changes to `index.js`, jest will watch for these changes and output whether you are passing or failing the included tests.

#### Working on Other Problems

If you want to work on other problems, point `jest` to the proper folder name.

* `jest reverse-int/test.js --watch` 
* `jest reverse-string/test.js --watch` 
* `jest array-chunking/test.js --watch`
