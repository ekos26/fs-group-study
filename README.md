### Install dependencies for testing

Run `npm install`. This should install the dependency `jest`, a npm package used for testing.

### Example Usage

If you want to work on `check-palindrome`, run the command `jest check-palindrome/test.js --watch` from the root folder. This will watch for any changes in the `index.js` file in the folder `check-palindromes`. As you work on a solution and save changes to `index.js`, jest will watch for these changes and output whether you are passing or failing the included tests.

If you want to work on other problems, replace `check-palindrome` with any other folder name.

Examples:

`jest reverse-int/test.js --watch`
`jest reverse-string/test.js --watch`
`jest array-chunking/test.js --watch`
